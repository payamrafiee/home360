          <p className="text-secondary">
            This is probably the biggest benefit – virtual
            reality solutions save time for both clients and
            realtors. Thanks to VR, there’s no need to travel
            from one property to another and sit in traffic
            jams. Instead, clients can simply put on VR
            headsets and enjoy immersive 3D
            tours.
          </p>
          <p className="text-secondary">
            Moreover, the use of virtual reality in real estate
            means that all listed properties are open around the
            clock. With the help of VR headsets, homebuyers can
            visit houses and apartments literally any time, without
            realtors needing to spend a second of their time.

            Builds Emotional Connections
          </h5>
          <p className="text-secondary">
            Virtual tours of houses and apartments help your
            clients visualize each property. Unlike
            traditional visits when everyone is in a hurry,
            potential buyers can take VR home tours at a time
            that’s convenient and can focus their attention
            on details.
          </p>
          <p className="text-secondary">
            Full immersiveness of virtual house tours creates
            an emotional connection and engages clients a lot
            more efficiently than conventional 2D images,
            which may look quite a bit different from how a
            property looks in person.

            With the data given to AI, it can provide with
            meaningful predictions involving customer priority.
            For example, it can predict what is going to be the
            price of an area based on the geographical area and
            based on future development or physical changes that
            the area might go through. It can also predict what
            area is more prone to theft or other crimes since it
            is an important aspect for anyone to consider while
            buying or renting a home.

          <p className="text-secondary">
            Virtual reality can change this. Since most properties
            can be shown through virtual tours, realtors can work
            more productively. Also, it doesn’t matter where your
            clients live. VR helps you showcase properties even to
            long-distance buyers. Of course, this means you can work
            with more clients and process more inquiries.

            Saves Money

          <p className="text-secondary">
            Developing feature-rich 3D virtual tours may seem
            expensive, but think of the investment in
            traditional real estate marketing. Not only do
            you need to stage properties, you also need to
            provide high-quality pictures and lots of print
            materials (particularly for new properties).
          </p>
          <p className="text-secondary">
            Virtual reality helps you save a lot of money by
            using the power of 360-degree videos and computer
            graphics. Today, making a guided video tour around
            a property requires just a panoramic camera and
            basic rendering.

          </h5>
          <p className="text-secondary">
            You can enhance the customer experience by providing
            virtual tours with lots of interactive add-ons such
            as mortgage calculators, information about similar
            properties, and descriptions of neighborhoods. This
            will help your clients get all the information they
            need about properties before contacting you and
            asking to arrange real visits of houses or apartments
            they like most.
